# Welcome to my blog!
You can better view my blog at [Medium @ danparkk](http://medium.com/@danparkk)!

I started this blog as a way of learning JavaScript in greater detail than what some might consider relevant for actual practice. I personally believe understanding the details is a prerequisite for mastery and better command over the language in all its idiosyncrasies.

I will also write about Reactjs and Redux (because I love React) and aim to go levels deeper than what might be needed to make a simple React app.

My motto: The details matter!
